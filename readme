This is a program that uses very basic python code to calculate a bill to include tax.

The main file is "homepage.py".
"functions.py" is a module storing various functionalities of the program.

The program first begins by taking 2 inputs from the user: their name and the amount spent on the tab.

The program then calculates the bill to include tax, shows this new cost to the user and displays a send-off message
that is a standard form stored in "read.txt".

The amount spent is also pushed and stored into the "write.txt".
